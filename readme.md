## V Pay Visa Master Payment Integration


V Pay payments are processed as a credit card payment. Therefore, credit card payments must be enabled within your MultiSafepay Control to process a V Pay payment. Submit your request to enable credit cards (Visa, Mastercard and Maestro) to your account manager.

A V Pay payment is always validated with the 3D secure code. 3D secure verification is deemed mandatory by V Pay.

V Pay payments are processed through the VISA gateway when Visa is activated as a payment method in your MultiSafepay Control.
